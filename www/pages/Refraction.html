 <h1>Refraction</h1>
 <div class="physicsTextInfo">
<br>
<br>
<p>
Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another
</p>

<p>
This bending by refraction makes it possible for us to have lenses, magnifying glasses, prisms and rainbows. Even our eyes depend upon this bending of light. 
Without refraction, we wouldn’t be able to focus light onto our retina.
</p>

<br>

<br>
<p>
When light travels from air into water, it slows down, causing it to change direction slightly.
This change of direction is called refraction. When light enters a more dense substance (higher refractive index), it ‘bends’ more towards the normal line.
</p>
<p>
The amount of bending depends on two things:
<br>
_Change in speed
<br>
_Angle of the incident ray
</p>
<p>
If light enters any substance with a higher refractive index (such as from air into glass) it slows down. The light bends towards the normal line.
<br>
If light travels enters into a substance with a lower refractive index (such as from water into air) it speeds up. The light bends away from the normal line.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Lens</h2>
<p>
A lens is simply a curved block of glass or plastic. There are two kinds of lens.
</p>

<p>
A biconvex lens is thicker at the middle than it is at the edges. This is the kind of lens used for photography.
<br>
Parallel rays of light can be focused in to a focal point. A biconvex lens is called a converging lens.
</p>

<br>

<br>
<p>
The crystalline of the eye is similar to a biconvex lens. The thickness of the crystalline will change depending on the distance between to eye and the object taht emits light
<br>
Tanks to that, the focal point is on the retina, and that allows us to see clearly.Otherwise we see blurry.
</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>
A biconcave lens curves is thinner at the middle than it is at the edges. Light rays refract outwards (spread apart) as they enter the lens and again as they leave.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Refraction can create a spectrum</h2>
<p>
When white light shines through a prism, each colour refracts at a slightly different angle
<br>
 A prism can be used to show the seven colours of the spectrum that make up white light.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The explanation for the colours separating out is that the light is made of waves.
<br>
Violet light slows down even more than red light, so it is refracted at a slightly greater angle.
</p>
<br>
<p>
A rainbow is formed when light enters each water droplet, and the different colours bend (refract) at slightly different angles.
They reflect off the inside of the drop before refracting again as they leave.
</p>
<br>
<img src="./../img/Rainbow.png">
<br>
<p>
The secondary rainbow that can sometimes be seen is caused by each ray of light reflecting twice on the inside of each droplet before it leaves.
<br>
This second reflection causes the colours on the secondary rainbow to be reversed.
<br>
Red is at the top for the primary rainbow, but in the secondary rainbow, red is at the bottom.
